## SIR Model for CIDD Workshop

### About this project

This is from a CIDD workshop on 20230330 given by Callum Arnold

This ISR model this is based on Ottar's book code from chapter 2. It's a simple SIR model with births and deaths

```math
\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= \mu (N - S) -\beta S \frac{I}{N} \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta S \frac{I}{N} - \gamma I - \mu I \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I - \mu R
\end{align}
```

```math
\begin{align}
\mu &= \frac{1}{50*52} \\
\beta &= 2 \\
\gamma &= \frac{1}{2} \\\\

N &= 1000 \\
S_0 &= 999.0 \\
I_0 &= 1.0 \\
R_0 &= 0.0
\end{align}
```
